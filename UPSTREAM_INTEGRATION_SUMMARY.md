# Upstream Integration Summary

## Changes Integrated from doobidoo/mcp-memory-service

### 1. Enhanced delete_by_tag Functionality ✅

**What was added:**
- `delete_by_tag` now accepts both single tag (string) and multiple tags (list)
- Added `delete_by_tags` as an alias for clarity when using list input
- Added `delete_by_all_tags` for AND logic (delete memories with ALL specified tags)
- Improved error messages showing which tags were actually matched

**Key improvements:**
- More flexible API that handles both string and array inputs
- Better user feedback with matched tags in response messages
- Two deletion modes: ANY (OR logic) and ALL (AND logic)

**Implementation details:**
- Updated `ChromaMemoryStorage.delete_by_tag()` in `src/mcp_memory_service/storage/chroma.py`
- Added new methods while preserving async/locking infrastructure
- Updated MCP tool definitions in `src/mcp_memory_service/server.py`
- Added corresponding handlers for the new functionality

### 2. Improved Timestamp Handling ✅

**What was added:**
- Enhanced memory reconstruction with fallback logic for timestamps
- Support for multiple timestamp formats: `created_at`, `timestamp_float`, `timestamp_str`
- Separate tracking of creation and update times
- ISO format timestamps alongside float timestamps

**Key improvements:**
- Better backward compatibility with legacy timestamp fields
- More robust timestamp handling across different storage scenarios
- Consistent timestamp restoration in all retrieval methods

**Implementation details:**
- Updated memory reconstruction in `search_by_tag()`, `recall()`, and `retrieve()` methods
- Added fallback chain: `created_at` → `timestamp_float` → `timestamp`
- Preserved all our existing timestamp synchronization logic

### 3. Preserved Fork Features ✅

All of our fork's improvements were maintained:
- **Concurrent access with file locking** - All methods use `@with_chroma_lock` decorator
- **True async operations** - All ChromaDB operations use `self._run_async()`
- **Thread pool executor** - Non-blocking behavior preserved
- **Process locking** - Auto-sync manager single-instance guarantee

## Testing

Created comprehensive test script (`test_delete_by_tag_enhancement.py`) that verifies:
- Single tag deletion (string input)
- Multiple tag deletion with OR logic (list input)
- All tags deletion with AND logic
- Edge cases (empty list, invalid types, non-existent tags)
- Timestamp fallback logic

All tests pass successfully! ✅

## Files Modified

3. `/home/felipe/mcp-memory-service/src/mcp_memory_service/models/memory.py`
   - Added missing logger import (minor fix)

4. `/home/felipe/mcp-memory-service/pyproject.toml`
   - Added `python-dateutil>=2.8.2` dependency

## Next Steps

1. Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
2. Test with concurrent access scenarios
3. Update documentation if needed
4. Consider creating a PR to merge these changes

## Notes

- The upstream implementation didn't include the async/locking infrastructure we have, so we had to adapt their changes to work with our concurrent access system
- The timestamp improvements were already partially implemented in our fork, but we enhanced them with the upstream's fallback logic
- Dashboard-related features from upstream were not integrated as they're lower priority
