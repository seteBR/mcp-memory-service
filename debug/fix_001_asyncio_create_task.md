# Fix 001: AsyncIO Create Task Error in Enhanced Server

## Issue
The memory MCP server was failing to start with the following error:
- `asyncio.create_task()` was being called in the `__init__` method before any event loop was running
- This caused the server initialization to fail when called from Claude Desktop

## Root Cause
In `src/mcp_memory_service/enhanced_server.py`, line 69 had:
```python
asyncio.create_task(self._start_auto_sync())
```

This was being called during object initialization (`__init__`), but at that point no asyncio event loop is running yet.

## Solution
Moved the task creation to a deferred initialization that happens after the event loop is running:

1. Removed the `asyncio.create_task()` call from `__init__`
2. Added initialization flags:
   - `self._auto_sync_task = None`
   - `self._init_complete = False`
3. Modified the `handle_list_tools()` handler to create the task on first call:
   ```python
   if not self._init_complete and self.code_intelligence_enabled and self._auto_sync_task is None:
       self._init_complete = True
       self._auto_sync_task = asyncio.create_task(self._start_auto_sync())
   ```

## Files Modified
- `src/mcp_memory_service/enhanced_server.py`
  - Line 67: Changed to `self._auto_sync_task = None`
  - Lines 77-79: Added initialization tracking
  - Lines 499-501: Added deferred task creation in list_tools handler

## Testing
- Server can now be instantiated without an active event loop
- Auto-sync task is created after server is fully initialized
- Compatible with Claude Desktop's MCP server initialization
