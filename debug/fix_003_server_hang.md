# Fix 003: Server Initialization Hang

## Issue
The memory MCP server hangs after printing diagnostics, both with and without code intelligence enabled. The server appears to start but never responds to MCP protocol messages.

## Investigation
1. Server prints diagnostics successfully
2. Hangs after diagnostics, before stdio server starts
3. Occurs with both regular server and enhanced server
4. Not specific to code intelligence feature
5. Claude Desktop shows "connecting..." then fails with timeout

## Symptoms
- Server hangs after printing system diagnostics
- No response to MCP initialize messages
- Timeout occurs even with simple test messages
- Both `uv run memory` and direct Python execution affected

## Root Cause
The server is likely hanging in the initialization phase, possibly:
1. During ChromaDB client initialization
2. In the sentence transformer model loading
3. Due to a blocking I/O operation
4. Network request timeout (telemetry, model download)

## Next Steps
1. Add more debug logging to pinpoint exact hang location
2. Check for blocking operations in initialization
3. Test with offline mode / no network
4. Verify ChromaDB persistence directory permissions
