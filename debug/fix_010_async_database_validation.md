# Fix 010: Async Database Validation Functions

## Issue
The `check_database_health` MCP tool was failing with error:
```
Error checking database health: object tuple can't be used in 'await' expression
```

## Root Cause
The `validate_database()` function in `db_utils.py` was synchronous, but was being called with `await` in multiple places in `server.py`. This mismatch between sync and async caused the error.

## Solution
Converted `validate_database()` and `repair_database()` to async functions and updated all calls accordingly.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `src/mcp_memory_service/utils/db_utils.py`
- Changed `def validate_database()` to `async def validate_database()`
- Changed `def repair_database()` to `async def repair_database()`
- Updated internal calls to use `await validate_database()`

### 2. Updated `src/mcp_memory_service/server.py`
- Removed `loop.run_in_executor()` calls for `validate_database` and `repair_database`
- Changed to direct `await` calls since functions are now async
- Updated in 3 locations:
  - `handle_check_database_health()` - already had await
  - `validate_database_health()` method (first instance)
  - `validate_database_health()` method (second instance)

## Testing
After restarting Claude Desktop (to reload the MCP service):
```
mcp__memory__check_database_health()
```

Should now return proper database health information without the async/await error.

## Impact
- Database validation is now properly async
- No blocking of the event loop during validation
- Consistent async pattern throughout the codebase
