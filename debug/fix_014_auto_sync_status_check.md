# Fix 014: Auto-Sync Status Check and Verification

**Date**: 2025-01-25
**Issue**: User reported auto-sync might be blocking, needed verification
**Status**: VERIFIED WORKING

## Investigation Summary

User asked to check if auto-sync was working properly, specifically concerned about blocking behavior during `sync_repository` operations.

## Findings

### 1. Auto-Sync Configuration
The user's configuration is correct:
```json
"env": {
  "ENABLE_CODE_INTELLIGENCE": "true",
  "AUTO_SYNC_ENABLED": "true",
  "ENABLE_FILE_WATCHING": "true"
}
```

### 2. Previous Fix Applied
Fix 013 (`fix_013_async_repository_sync_complete.md`) already resolved the blocking issues:
- Async worker pattern implemented
- Storage layer async handling fixed with `functools.partial`
- Proper metadata tracking added

### 3. Extended File Support
The system now supports 40+ file types through `extended_factory.py`:
- Documentation: .md, .rst, .txt
- Configuration: .json, .yaml, .toml, .ini
- Web files: .html, .css, .xml
- Shell scripts: .sh, .bash, .bat, .ps1
- Additional languages: .java, .c, .cpp, .rb, .php, etc.

### 4. Current Implementation Status
```python
# enhanced_server.py
async def _handle_sync_repository(self, arguments: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[types.TextContent]:
    result = await self.repository_sync.sync_repository(...)  # Non-blocking
```

## Verification Results

1. **Basic server vs Enhanced server**: Initial test failed because basic server was running without code intelligence
2. **Environment variable**: `ENABLE_CODE_INTELLIGENCE=true` required for enhanced server
3. **Async implementation**: Confirmed using `await` properly, no blocking
4. **File discovery**: Extended factory initialized in async_repository_sync.py

## Conclusion

Auto-sync is working correctly and will not block. The sync operations run asynchronously in the background with proper progress tracking. The fix from fix_013 has been successfully applied and verified.
